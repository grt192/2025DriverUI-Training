# Setup
This section will introduce useful tools to help you set up the 
developing environment.

## IDE
VSCode can be used to develop Python, but you will have to install the 
Python extension.  
Alternatively, you can also use PyCharm if you perfer it.

## Package Management
Although not required, it's recommended to install anaconda as it helps 
you manage different packages and creates isolated enviroments.  

## Python Versions and Packages
The 2024 Driver UI used Python 3.10, so it's recommended to use Python 
3.10. If you perfer another version, however, feel free to use it.  
The packages and versions used in the 2024 Driver UI can be found in the 
[requirements.txt](https://github.com/grt192/DriverUI2024/blob/main/requirements.txt)
file. Again, this file is only a reference, not a requirement.
